Part 1.

- git checkout -b Branch_Name or git switch -c Branch_Name

- Fast-forward merge is the most basic and simplest, easiest way to merge branches, history is just one straight-line chronologically, won't create any conflicts during merge branches.
Recursive is necessary to be used when non-chronological commits happen. 

- git checkout Branch_Name or git switch Branch_Name

- git branch -d Branch_Name

- It happens when try to merge branches and there is multiple different changes onto same files from different branches.

Part 2.

//switch to a new branch called "practice2"
learn_git_again % git switch -c practice2
Switched to a new branch 'practice2'

//see the list of file

//check the status
learn_git_again % git status
On branch practice2
nothing to commit, working tree clean

// add and commit the file
learn_git_again % git add .
