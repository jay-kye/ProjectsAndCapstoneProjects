Pt 2.
1. `man` command shows manuals of each command. I can scroll using `Enter`key, up-down cursor on keyboard or a mouse to scroll. Enter `Q` key to get out.
2. `-l` flag does List files in the long format, `-a` flag does it all appears hidden. Normally begin with “.”(dot)
3. `opt + left/right arrow keys on keyboard`
4. `control + e`
5. `control + a`
6. `control + w`
7. Shell is the program which actually processes commands and returns output, and terminal is referring to a wrapper program which runs a shell.
8. Absolute paths are the path starting from the root. i.e., /user/jay/desktop
9. Relative paths are relative to work place where I am currently. i.e., cd desktop 
10. Flags can change and even enhance commands. I did use -r, -rf, -a flags.
11. `-r` flag with `rm` command does to attempt to remove the file hierarchy rooted in each file argument. And `-f` flag with `rm` command does to Attempt to remove the files without prompting for confirmation, regardless of the file's permissions. Combine these two flags with `rm` command which `rm -rf` can delete entire targeted folder and can not go back to restore unless have back up.
